# Python_tools
Python script I use for various purpose

Those scripts are not clean nor always safe to use.
A lot of documentation is missing, and even sometimes is missleading.
I won't advise anyone else to use those, i just want to have the same version
of my scripts on all my workstations to ensure repeatability and compatibility.

I will clean them , hopefully, in the near futur.
